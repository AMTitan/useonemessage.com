        <h1>Use one message</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Have you ever found yourself talking about something but saying it in multiple messages? This might sound innocent but it can be very annoying. Take this example: </p>
        <quoteblock>
            (9:15:30) <b>Foo</b> I just found out the craziest thing <br>
            (9:15:37) <b>Foo</b> when you fullscreen a video on youtube <br>
            (9:15:48) <b>Foo</b> you can actually scroll down to see the comments <br>
            (9:15:55) <b>Foo</b> like without going out of fullscreen <br>
            (9:16:04) <b>Foo</b> how did I never findout about this?
        </quoteblock>
        <p>This is a normal message that I might see from some people; the thing is, they are using a new message as a new sentence. I believe you should put this all into one message for two main points.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I don't want to see you type out your message. For the example I showed, it might not seem that bad as this was an opening message, but say we were having a back-and-forth conversation and you did this. You could be asking why I don't want to see you type out your message, as it's not causing any harm, but if I am invested in reading what you are writing, I now have to wait for you to fully finish typing your messages to understand what your whole point is. I can read your messages much faster than you can type them, so I don't want to have to pause after every sentence to let you write the next one.</li>
            <li>I don't want to waste my precious screen height on your messages. Every platform is capable on text wraping; I don't need you to do it for me. If I am on a smaller screen, then the text wrapping is going to have to wrap every one of your messages in a non-optimal way, wasting screen height.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The first example could easily be converted to: </p>
        <quoteblock>
            (9:16:45) <b>Foo</b> I just found out the craziest thing, when you fullscreen a video on youtube. You can actually scroll down to see the comments even while still being fullscreened. How did I never know of this?
        </quoteblock>
        <p>The first example would take me at least 34 seconds to read the full thought, as I would have to wait for every new message to come in. With the improved example, I read it as quickly as I want and can instantly form a reply. It might take longer for your message to come out, but I can read it easier and wont have the feeling of waiting.</p>
