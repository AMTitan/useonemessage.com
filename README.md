# Use one message

Have you ever found yourself talking about something but saying it in
multiple messages? This might sound inocent but it can be very annoying.
Take this example:

> (9:15:30) **Foo** I just found out the craziest thing\
> (9:15:37) **Foo** when you fullscreen a video on youtube\
> (9:15:48) **Foo** you can actually scroll down to see the comments\
> (9:15:55) **Foo** like without going out of fullscreen\
> (9:16:04) **Foo** how did I never findout about this?

This is a normal message that I might see from some people; the thing
is, they are using a new message as a new sentence. I believe you should
put this all into one message for two main points.

1.  I don\'t want to see you type out your message. For the example I
    showed, it might not seem that bad as this was an opening message,
    but say we were having a back-and-forth conversasion and you did
    this. You could be asking why I don\'t want to see you type out your
    message, as it\'s not causing any harm, but if I am invested in
    reading what you are writing, I now have to wait for you to fully
    finish typing your messages to understand what your whole point is.
    I can read your messages much faster than you can type them, so I
    don\'t want to have to pause after every sentence to let you write
    the next one.
2.  I don\'t want to waste my precious screen height on your messages.
    Every platform is capable on text wraping; I don\'t need you to do
    it for me. If I am on a smaller screen, then the text wrapping is
    going to have to wrap every one of your messages in a non-optimal
    way, wasting screen height.

The first example could easily be converted to

> (9:16:45) **Foo** I just found out the craziest thing, when you
fullscreen a video on youtube. You can actually scroll down to see the
comments even while still being fullscreened. How did I never know of
this?

The first example would take me at least 34 seconds to read the full
thought, as I would have to wait for every new message to come in. With
the improved example, I read it as quickly as I want and can instantly
form a reply. It might take longer for your message to come out, but I
can read it easier and wont have the feeling of waiting.
